# Student Performance Analyzer (NumPy Project)

This project uses **NumPy** to analyze the academic performance of students across multiple subjects.
It demonstrates array manipulation, statistics, and data processing — all without using Pandas — to give a strong foundation in numerical computing.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate a small student dataset and perform various analysis tasks using **NumPy only**. It helps build strong foundations in:

- 2D array creation and manipulation
- Axis-wise aggregation
- Boolean masking & conditionals
- Normalization techniques
- Real-world logic like pass/fail detection, ranking, and statistics

## 🧠 What This Project Does
- Stores student marks in a structured NumPy array
- Calculates:
  - Total and average scores per student
  - Subject-wise performance
  - Top-performing student(s)
- Performs:
  - Score normalization (0–1 range)
  - Pass/Fail tagging using Boolean logic
- (Optional) Can be extended with visualization using Matplotlib

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- NumPy 📊
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/numpy-student-analyzer.git
```
2. Open the `student_performance_analyzer.ipynb` in **Jupyter** or **Colab**
3. Run each cell to see the analysis
